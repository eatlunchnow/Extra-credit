# Extra-credit
My view of technology has changed for the better and slightly for the worse due to this class. For the better because I have a
stronger semblance of how the internet works. I had the basic idea of the inner workings of the internet. I know what an e-mail
was but I could not explain how it was sent from one computer to another. I did not know what DNS stood for or why it is an
integral component of the internet or even why IP addresses are a thing. I know about the internal parts of a computer 
(my favorite class by the way). Of course I’ve seen the inside of the CPU but had never dissected it, took pieces out, and saw 
processors and the like. 
My view of technology has worsened because of the lack of real protection using the internet and the tremendous lack of diversity
in tech. With all the reports of hacking it is not difficult to know security is an issue if you use the internet. The scope was
a lot worse than I had first anticipated. I can’t say I am paranoid but I can admit it is a legitimate concern of mine and I have
changed how I work on the internet. Being a woman of color I already knew the lack of diversity in tech was abysmal. That is one
reason why I want to entire that field. In turn a tech work environment without diversity will be that more difficult to navigate
if you are a marginalized person. This class made me think more about how to deal with the daily microaggressions that I am sure
will take place and how intersectionality is not widely accepted yet.
